A [CLAP] plugin runtime. Very much WIP. ðŸš§

You can find the documentation at [docs.rs][documentation].

[CLAP]: https://cleveraudio.org

[documentation]: https://docs.rs/clap-clap/latest/clap_clap/

# Goals

* Provide a dynamical runtime environment to access [CLAP API] from safe Rust.
* Follow CLAP terminology and the framework of CLAP extension modules.
* Build a testing and debugging platform for plugin authors.

[CLAP API]: https://github.com/free-audio/clap/tree/main/include/clap

# Example (plugin template)

You can find the source code of a simple plugin template [here].

To compile the sources, install Rust `1.85.0` or later (for the Rust 2024
edition) and clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mira-merkell/clap-clap
```

Build the example plugin with:

```bash
cargo build --example plugin_template --release
```

and look for the compiled dynamical library in `target/release/examples/`. The
name of the library is OS-specific:

* Linux: `libplugin_template.so`
* Windows: `plugin_template.dll`
* macOS: `libplugin_template.dylib`

Copy the file to where your DAW can find it and rename it to:
`plugin_template.clap`.

[here]: ./examples/plugin_template.rs

# Installation

You can install this library like any other dependency of your crate:

```bash
cargo add clap-clap
```

A CLAP plugin is a dynamical library with C ABI and a symbol `clap_entry`
visible to the host that would load the plugin. To compile your plugin with the
right ABI, specify the crate type in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
# Cargo.toml

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
```

To export the entry symbols and build a plugin factory that the host can use to
crate instances of your plugin use [`clap_clap::entry!`] macro. There macro can
be invoked only once in the entire plugin code, but you can bundle multiple
plugins into one compiled artefact. For example, assuming you have types
`MyPlug`
and `MyPlugToo` that implement [`Plugin`], you can export them by:

```rust
clap_clap::entry!(MyPlug, MyPlugToo);
```

This will create one library that you can install as a `*.clap` plugin bundle of
two plugins defined by `MyPlug` and `MyPlugToo`.
