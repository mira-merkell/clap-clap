//! CLAP Extensions.
//!
//! The [CLAP API] defines the interface between plugins and hosts, treating
//! both extensions equallyâ€”there's no distinction in how extensions are used by
//! either.
//!
//! This library adopts the plugin's perspective, meaning there is only one
//! host. Host extensions are concrete types found in the [`ext::host`] module.
//!
//! Plugin extensions, on the other hand, are implemented by the library user as
//! traits in the [`ext::plugin`] module. This module also provides some
//! concrete implementations for convenience, such as the [`StereoPorts`] type,
//! which defines a static stereo port layout.
//!
